Portfolio page showing recent projects as a Conservatio Data Analyst [Python, R, SQL]

I am *Felix Hinsch*, i am a Marine Biologist that specializes in Conservation Data Analysis. 
I finished my MSc in Marine Biology in 2024 at the University of Rostock in Germany and have sinced worked in Shark Conservation
and on freelance Conservation Data projects. 

My last work position was as a volunteer Research Coordinator at Sharklife Conservation Group South Africa. This role included hands on data collection and volunteer in field work
as well as data analysis for conservation purposes.

I thrive in remote environments, i am used to long days in the field and office and I am extraordinarily organized. I would say that efficiency is one of my hidden talents,
because I always find a way to do things more efficient and think outside the box.

My high affinity for technology which i learned in my past years in corporate IT mix perfectly with my skills in dirty marine field work. 
Understanding data fully, from the point of collection to the output of a statistical analysis allows me to very efficiently work with data sets and identify problems.

This page is a portfolio collection for my recent projects working with R, Python, SQL, and GIS to support applications.
